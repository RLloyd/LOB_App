AngularJS Line of Business Application
This exercise is based on the Pluralsight online course by Deborah Kurata

Topics covered that I was really interested:
- UI_Router
- $resource
- $httpBackend

Exercise breakdown:
x1:
- Using ng-init to populate the view template (html) with some json data within the table element

x2:
Define Angular module method:
- Setter method needs 2 parameters, name and DI array (of dependencies)
- ie: angular.module("moduleName", [DI's]);
- Getter method: angular.module("moduleName");
- THE IIFE JS Pattern: Immediately-Invoked Function Expression. (function(){...}()); aka: Self-executing anonymous function
	• IIFE is a function expression and not a function declaration.

Add Controller Function by registration:
- Start with the IIFE
- Look up the module
- Registering the controller with the module
	• angular.module("gdApp").controller("ProductListCtrl", function ProductListCtrl(DIs){...);
- Write the code for the controller

The use of "Controller As" :: simplified $scope handling
- $scope is not required as a parameter
- Model and methods are defined on the controller itself
- Reference using an alias
- $scope still exists behind the scenes

Added bootstrap.css to beautify the view.
- class = "panel panel-primary"...

The working project gets populated from the ProductListController.
Images can be shown and hide using ng-if and not ng-show.
ng-if only fetch the image data when called.

x3:
Define another module called common.services
- Add the ff as DIs:
	- ngResource
	- ProductResourceService
